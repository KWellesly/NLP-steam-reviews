       " 'any longtime dead by daylight player knows that this isnt a horror game if youre looking for scares i wouldnt consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time it doesnt have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer that said and set aside i enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killers line of sight and giving them the slip it can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock there have been times where i have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and its one of the aspects that drew me to dead by daylight its a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught on the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting as with any game i feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes its possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun i give dead by daylight an 810 and ive enjoyed my many hours playing and so i will recommend',\n",

settings there is a resolution slidebar available 0 100 you are able to play this game on fullscreen or windowed mode volume settings information there is a main volume slidebar available 0 100 there is a menu volume slidebar available 0 100 headphones are recommended miscellaneous information there are alot of different languages available you are able to play the game with a controller there is a mouse and controller sensitivity slidebar available 0 100 for killer and survivor both seperated you are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller there is a manual tutorialhelptips available about the game you can choose between a survivor or a killer you are able to have 4 survivors in a match and 1 killer each side has an objective the killer has to kill all 4 survivors in order to win while the survivors has to escape from the map survivors are using third person camera and killers are using a first person camera each survivor or a killer has their own level and perk system so if you have unlocked an offering the offering can only be used in a match if you play that certain character survivors are able to use items and increase the effect of the item by adding add ons while the killer has a default power ability which can be improved by adding add ons offerings could be used to change the match or by gaining more points the game is trial and error and will be difficult in the beginning while the game is pretty dark by itself you are able to increase the brightness by darkening your own room or increase the brightness on your computer monitor this may have a little impact or no impact at all but if you are close to a window or the sun has the potential to shine into your room you could be put in a disadvantage as you will have a hard time looking at the screen or able to see things properly killer needs to kill the 4 survivors in order to win there are alot of different killers each with their own unique gameplay and perks some killers are able to go invisible or even stealth while other killers are using deadly tools to get their victims the killer has a first person camera perspective which means he cant use their camera to look around the walls for victims killers are able to see all generators and exit gates throughout the match which could help you locating survivors you will have to hunt down the survivors and they could reveal themself on the map if they are failing a skillcheck helping a survivor off the hook or destroying a hex totem chasing a survivor will start the chase music until the victim is down or escaped an injured or a running survivor will leave a trail of red marks around the location which you need to track down in order to kill them a killer is able to hear nearby gruntingmoaning sound when a survivor is injured the killer is able to kick generators to slow and decrease the generator progress or destroying thrown pallets by kicking them killers are generally faster than a survivor and the killers movement speed will increase the longer the chase goes as they have bloodlust survivor needs to escape from the map by completing generators to power up the exit gate or they are able to find a hatch there are alot of different survivors each with their own gameplay and perks some are good for co op actions while others are quickly survivors have a third person camera which will allow them to see around the walls and keep the killer at a distance you will have to find generators to power up the exit gates to make your escape generators are randomly spawned on the map and could be located by looking up as you will see sparky flashlights from time to time you will receive a skillcheck which you will need to success in order to prevent the generator blowing up and able to reveal your location on the game blowing up generators will lose some of your progess and could put you into danger as well by reparing enough generators the exit gates will be powered up and you could leave the area after opening the gates you could also find a hatch which will allow you to escape but the killer is able to grab you out of the hatch if he is quick enough there are 2 hitchecks on a skillcheck the thick white bar and a smaller bar before the skillcheck will pop up you will hear a ping sound hitting the bigger white bar will gain you more experience and you will gain 2 more progress but you are better off focusing on the smaller bar as it will be alot easier to hit most actions ingame require a skillcheck and missing a skillcheck will reveal your location to the killer you are able to find items in crates such a medkit or a toolbox items has a quality level and make them more powerful the higher it is items are usually an one time thing as you will lose them if you have died or they run out of charges you are able to to carry an item to the next match if you have escaped the survivor is able to jump over windows throw down pallets or hide in lockers lockers are not a good hiding location and you will be instantly grabbed by the killer if spotted you are better off crouching and hiding behind obstactles a common mistake what people are doing is running if they see a killer and it is close to a survivor they have a tendency to run which will be a big mistake as this will reveal your location to the killer alot easier you should only start running when you are being chased or you know for sure the killer isnt close to you ingame information moderate replayability good atmosphere dark graphical horror atmosphere has perks and level systems each survivorkiller has their own system dialy randoms quests to gain an insane ammount of experience miscellaneous information dwight and nea are both good beginning characters worst enemies could be your allies while the killer could be your friend pallets are buggy dont throw the pallet if you are facing it it could teleport you to the other side and screw you over other things the game isnt that fun as it may seem why if you are playing as a killer you will fight against a bunch of high skilled trolls and they are usally pre made as well they are mostly palletwindow jumping flashlighting and shamefully t bagging if you are playing as a survivor you will play against a killer that may be alot better than you are sometimes teammates are disconnecting in a middle of the match which will leave you in a disadvantage they also have the tendecies to really screw you over sometimes even on purpose survivors are generally alot more toxic salty trolly and generally have a negative attitude than a killer will ever get in this game killers mostly relies on mistakes from the survivors and sometimes are more friendlier than a survivor i will only suggest to buy this game whenever it is in a discount otherwise i would suggest to stay away from it the idea of the game is nice community however isnt and can be really frustating or game ruining i have reached the text review limit t t  reviews are always uploaded if i

daylight youll generally find two things genuine complaints about the bugs and people who simply arent good at the game talking about how this killer or that survivor perk is broken or nerfed lets be real for a moment lots and i mean lots of people are just bad at this game youll see them trust me they either cant learn to work as a part of a team or cant find others who try which is only a real problem at the lower ranks with all the other newbies or they dont have the stuff to take down a team on their own so to start dont pay attention to these particular complaints they are made by people who as the kids say suck at either specific aspects of the game or the game as a whole cons now on to credible cons the bugs too often render the game unplayable im looking at you loading screen bug if youre like me and used to playing buggy games this will be tolerable for you i mean having to exit the game several times and reboot it is by no means an issue to people who make a habit of playing games in their alphas were almost surprised when we dont ever have to relaunch a game if you dont like the waiting you may struggle with this and that would be a valid reason to avoid dead by daylight until such a time as the developers finally fix this issue among others of course i expect and encourage a lot of complaining about the loading screen bug sometimes youll get put in a lobby with someone either way above or way below your rank it happens youll get butchered by a rank 4 killer who isnt really enjoying it either mind you youre too easy and youll make a far too easy getaway from a rank 19 killer who hasnt yet learned how to look in the bushes this is frustrating for everyone in the lobby and youll probably catch some flak for it if you were the one misplaced the survivors in particular usually ranks 15 10 the ones who have gotten good at the game and are still in their angsty phase of play where they think everyone else sucks and should be told so can be a salty bunch more often than youll probably like youll get put in a lobby with an old mcdonalds wifi killer and youll lag badly enough that youll either die because of it or be disconnected entirely yeah its frustrating but that happens in any multiplayer game hosted by one of the players somehow people seem to attribute this flaw to dead by daylight in particular which is absurd that being said dedicated servers should they ever become available for the game would be fantastic and thats the half of this complaint that is completely valid pros now that weve addressed the major cons of the game lets look at some of the pros the way the leveling system works at its core is that you gain points and ranks based on how many points you scored in a match theres four ways for survivors and four ways for killers to get these points that on its own is a fairly basic and simple system the part of this system that makes the game great is what those ways to get points are for example as a survivor you gain points towards leveling by assisting saving or even just being near your fellow survivors you make progress in the game by helping each other a seamlessly introduced method of encouraging players to stick together as a killer you get points from using your chosen killers special power chainsaw short range teleporting etc meaning that youre inherently going to level up as certain killers better than others you do in fact make a special kind of progress by playing to your strengths speaking of leveling while your rank is static across all the different survivors and all the different killers each specific member of each group is counted and leveled individually this means that most of the time a jake park player is a jake park player thats who youre good at thats who you play it leaves room for diversity among players because its not as simple as this one does more damage so naturally everyone plays him  theres no one survivor or killer thats better than the next theyre all unique in some way and they all play to different types of players styles and tastes finally as a horror game enthusiast when i initially played dead by daylight i found that the fear that accompanies hiding from a monster that isnt an ai that is in fact another person was far more satisfying than waiting for the programmed beastie to finish its programmed patrol and move on when i knew it was safe you cant predict a killer as easily as that because its not nearly as easy to know what theyre doing are they really gone or did they take a few steps away to wait for you to come out is he revving up that chainsaw because he actually did see you or is he just trying to scare you out of hiding do you stay or do you go as i played on of course this fear eventually left me but it didnt fade away it transformed into strategy im not playing a game trying to figure out the patterns of the ai monster im trying to either outsmart and outrun or outsmart and run down another person this dynamic may not be as prevelant at the lower ranks which is natural given that at lower ranks players simply arent as experienced but should you stick to the game long enough youll find a unique kind of game that youre going to love just as much at rank 1 as you did at rank 20 if youre anything like me tl dr if you cant handle bugs waiting and lag this game probably isnt for you if youre prone to outrage when someones better at a game than you this game probably isnt for you if you can appreciate strategy skill and teamwork this game is for you 810 do recommend update dead by daylight is an ever growing ever changing game and its changed a lot since i started playing and since i wrote this review lots of new killers and survivors new maps new perks updates to the way things used to work i wont get into specifics but one thing you can definitely count on is that this game is not a stagnant one its still evolving and its still improving the community however has overall gotten much saltier since last writing thats something that cant really be helped by the developers or by other players it just is all of this being said ive found that the longer one plays dead by daylight the more hooked one becomes its not a game where playing for the first 100 hours is the highlight and it fades from attention after that in fact you dont even really begin to understand the game until youre much further in at 171 hours i know enough to stay alive and kill people a lot more efficiently than i used to but im still a rookie compared to some of the people that play this game with 500 1 000 3 000 hours logged if youre looking for a game thatll stick with you as long as you stick with it this is the place to be score remains at 810',\n",

       " 'started playing this on the free to play weekend and im byuing it join into a game with some randoms all goes well we get three generators up and running damn the killer got one of us they need a hero ill be the hero rest of the team dont care its up to me sneak up to the hook where the killer has my fellow survivor hooked up they have only seconds left i must save them i rush the killer and unhook my teammate killer knocks me down teamate runs killer chases and gets them again i did my best but alas it was not enough exit is opened start crawling for my life killer cant find me crawl across the whole map finally reach the exit the killer is waiting he is looking around in the grass i hide but once again it is not enough i get picked up just a few meters from the exit i wiggle as much as i can but the grip of the killer proves too much for my broken and bruised body i die a horrible death game over 1010 would crawl again',\n",
       " 'product received for free what a better way to let out my inner psychopath than to play dead by daylight until friday the 13th comes outif the devs would just add a voip feature for the killer where they can utter spooky nonsense thatd be even better 1010 would make my girlfriend cry by being dark af again',\n",
       " 'i like trains',\n",
       " 'cant recommend buying this game until they remove the gamebreaking ability to sabotage meathooks and completely rework claudette',\n",
       " 'super fun game still in development very unique',\n",
       " 'this game is so much fun obviously it has flaws like gltches overpowered killers underpowered killers however playing with friends and even by yourself is so addictive and so much fun i bought this game expecting to have around 10 hours played in total as id get bored however the grind to reach high levels doesnt feel like a grind at all with the daily challenges and it always feels like youre getting something new in the bloodweb which changes up your game slightly in the recent update where they changed the hooks it has helpoed against the camping killers by allowing a hook rotation so they can no longer block the survivors from saving thier friends many people dont like the survive with friends feature mainly because if they main killer they dont want the survivors to work together this is kind of dumb and if you think swf shouldnt be in the game youre probably a salty killer that went up against good players there is also a ranking system which resets monthly which helps you play against people your own skill level is very good get game',\n",
       " 'you can play your own style like if you want to help the team and be a medic you can be claudette or if you want to escape the killer at fast speed take meg for a spin or if you want to hel your self and team play laurie strode dwight if want to quickly heal up or get a gen done at a fast pace and jake if you want to make the killer get people to the basement and try to make it and maybe make them rage and if you want a fast moving person with jumping off high places or sneaking past killers play nea and if you want a juke defence play trapper or if want to get past pallots with speed nurse is for you or if want to suprise survivors on gens play wraith and to insta kill lake crazy which i think is annoying play the shapemyers',\n",
       " 'i love this game theres just a couple problems that i would like for the devs to do main thing is bugs the devs just keep making dlc and with the recent adition of leatherface i was a bit cause there doing nothing about the bugs the opitimazion in this game is horrendus and even with the best pcs they still cant run this game perfectly if they fix these problems the game would be perfect now i have had a lot more time with the game these reasons are still accurate',\n",
       " 'this is my first review and im sure you like myself have read a lot of them before making a purchase on steam i bought this game on sale for 9 99 and within i would say within 5 matches i went and bought all the dlc not necessary by any means to get extreme joy from this game i did not know that i already had access to all the levels trials and wasnt limited to matchmaking by not having them anyways if youre searching for that addictive video game fix because youre chasing the gaming dragon stop right here and purchase watch gameplay footage on youtube this game is so intense i still shout profanitys by being startled so much fun playing the killer and the survivor i have won as the killer about 3 games managed to kill all the survivors and escaped as a survivor about 20 played many more games as a survivor even if you lose on either side you still get xp to level up any character of your choosing that being either survivor or killer easy to learn with a very high grading curve of mastering what youre doing i will pour many more hours into this game it is heavily populated so it doesnt normally take more than a minute for a match to start when you search for a game normally about 20 seconds for me my complaints and a heads up host of the match trial is the killer and your latency depends on your connection to him you can see the latency before readying up for the match red is bad dont play a match with bad latency or you can expect to rubber band a lot if the killer leaves the match you get a win as a survivor and the game obviously ends good with that being said after the match is over and youre chatting up your ggs and what not when the killer leaves the lobby the chat goes with him sad minor bugs in the matchmaking menu that can be fixed by restarting the game this only seems to occur when i switch from playing survivor a couple of games in a row over to playing the killer idk sometimes i have to restart steam otherwise ill get stuck in matchmaking easy fix minor annoyence thats about it watch some beginner tip guides on youtube before you start nothing more annoying than a survivor who gets himself killed within the first three minute of the game from sprinting down the middle of the map i gave these guys like sixtyish bucks in all so i hope they use it and keep improving the game and not be spending it on cocaine and hookers i use a 360 controller and remapped my skill check from lb to a feels more comfortable that way and didnt conflict with anything else enjoy  glhf',\n",
