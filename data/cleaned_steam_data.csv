3,126,1086,676,False,Recommended,Out of all the reviews I wrote This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!,Dead by Daylight,out of all the reviews i wrote this one is probably the most

4,85,2139,612,False,Recommended,Disclaimer I survivor main. I play games for fun not for competition so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops) and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with) then no biggie. Next game please I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one) I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up there is always the next game )That being said this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it have fun with it and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!) and even then recognize that there are jerks who play this game like any other game and have fun while you compete!,Dead by Daylight,disclaimer i

5,4,55,2694,False,Recommended,"ENGLISH After playing for more than two years I am given the task of reviewing this game again.This review will be as complete as possible so if you do not want to see the full review I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as Pallets Windows 360's Moonwalks Hide Different powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.Rating Balance 6/10 Mechanical system 9/10 Innovation 8/10 Gameplay 8/10Graphics It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect. Animation 6/10 Optimization 5/10 Graphics 6/10 Matchmaking In this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but it's still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1. Servers 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusion This game has great potential for anyone who likes the ""Slasher"" or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors. That potential is covered up by big bugs.

I am from Mexico Thank you SPANISHDespués de estar jugando por mas de dos años me doy a la tarea de volver a hacer un reseña de este juego.Esta reseña sera lo mas completo posible así que si no quieres ver toda la reseña te recomiendo ir a la parte final de la reseña para ver la opinión y valoración final. Esta reseña estará compuesta por 4 apartados y algunos sub apartados. Gameplay Este juego consiste en que hay 4 superviviente y un asesino que deben completar una serie de objetivos en un mapa. Los supervivientes debe escapar del asesino reparando 5 generadores y abriendo unas puertas. Por su parte los asesinos debe perseguir colgar sacrificar o matar a los supervivientes.Los supervivientes y asesinos tienen la posibilidad de usar habilidades objetos accesorios y ofrendas que ayudan a dar ventaja dentro de una partida.Ofrece un buen mecánicas para escapar del asesino o atrapar al superviviente como Pallets Ventanas 360's Moonwalks Esconderse Poderes diferentes en cada killerEl balanceo es uno de los aspectos mas difíciles del juegos. En cada actualizacion se cambia el balanceo haciendo nerf o buff a los killer y supervivientes. En mi opinion hay muchas cosas donde el balanceo esta bien. pero hay muchas otras cosas que fallan mucho.Rating Balanceo 6/10 Mecánicas 9/10 Innovación 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Gráficos Usa el motor gráfico Unreal Engine 4 lo que es un motor con bastante buena iluminación y fácil de usar con respecto a otros motores. En el apartado gráfico optimización y animación de Dead by Daylight es mediocre por que hay bastantes bugs gráficos o animación pero se debe entender que que Behaviour no es Epic game para poder invertir tanto dinero en ese aspecto. Animación 6/10 Optimización 5/10 Gráficos 6/10 Matchmaking En este aspecto el juego ha mejorado bastante estos 2 años pero sigue siendo bastante mediocre Hay bastantes bugs en buscar killers y supervientes. Lo peor es que el host sea el killer y no haya servers. Y aparte falla mucho el sistema de rank hay partidas que te pueden tocar rangos 20 siendo rango 1.

Gracias",Dead by Daylight,english after playing for more than two years i am given the task of reviewing this game again this review will be as complete as possible so if you do not want to see the full review i recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating this review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections gameplaythis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors for its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as pallets windows 360s moonwalks hide different powers in each killerthe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors in my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good but there are many other things that fail a lot rating balance 610 mechanical system 910 innovation 810 gameplay 810graphics it uses the graphic engine unreal engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines in the graphic section optimization and animation dead by daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that behaviour is not epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect animation 610 optimization 510 graphics 610 matchmaking in this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but its still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients the worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers and besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1 servers 010 matchmaking 510 conclusion this game has great potential for anyone who likes the slasher or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors that potential is

6,12,228,48,False,Recommended,Out of all the reviews I wrote This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!,Dead by Daylight,out of all the reviews i wrote this one is probably the most

8,2,54,400,False,Recommended,Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside I enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing and so I will recommend.,Dead by Daylight,any longtime dead by daylight player knows that this isnt a horror game if youre

If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play.

26,0,0,61,False,Recommended,Very fun game I gifted the game to my friends and now we play it together.This game consists about a player being the killer there are different killers and each of them have different abilities survivors have to fix the required amount of generators and find the escape or secret exit.Killers must find all the survivors and hang them until they die.Features You get to choose if you want to be killer or survivor which is an option I really like.You can customize your characters buy DLC's to have more things to wear on your characters and in some DLC's you will also get new characters such as killers or survivors.Character perks add ons and offerings You get to add items or power ups to your character + offerings that if you win grants you boosts.There is an option to make a private game called ''Kill your friends'' where you have to play as the killer against your friends that play as survivor you get to choose any perk add on and offerings for your character and you can also choose the map for your custom/private game.DLC'S As I mentioned before there are DLC's these DLC's give you either accesories or killers &amp survivors.CAMPERS Yes there are many campers in this game that will stay right next to you until you die so another player doesn't rescue you however you can counter it by pulling off a distraction.BUGS From what I've seen so far there are around 2 bugs that don't affect your gameplay.This game is worth it but if you don't believe me try watching a gameplay like I did before!10/10 I never get tired of playing it!,Dead by

29,0,0,104,False,Recommended,"Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Multiplayer horror action game.Interface/Menu/SettingsVideo Settings information. You are able to play on Low Quality Graphical settings. There is a resolution slidebar available. 0% 100% You are able to play this game on Fullscreen or windowed mode.Volume Settings Information. There is a main volume slidebar available. 0% 100% There is a Menu volume slidebar available. 0% 100% Headphones are recommended.Miscellaneous Information. There are alot of different languages available. You are able to play the game with a controller There is a mouse and controller sensitivity slidebar available. 0% 100% For Killer and survivor (both seperated). You are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller. There is a manual Tutorial/help/tips available.About the game.You can choose between a Survivor or a killer. You are able to have 4 survivors in a match and 1 killer. Each side has an objective. The killer has to kill all 4 survivors in order to win while the survivors has to escape from the map. Survivors are using third person camera and killers are using a first person camera. Each survivor or a killer has their own level and perk system. So if you have unlocked an offering the offering can only be used in a match if you play that certain character.Survivors are able to use items and increase the effect of the item by adding add ons while the killer has a default power ability which can be improved by adding add ons. Offerings could be used to change the match or by gaining more points. The game is Trial and error and WILL BE DIFFICULT IN THE BEGINNING.While the game is pretty dark by itself you are able to increase the brightness by darkening your own room or increase the brightness on your computer monitor. This may have a little impact or no impact at all but if you are close to a window or the sun has the potential to shine into your room. You could be put in a disadvantage as you will have a hard time looking at the screen or able to see things properly. Killer needs to kill the 4 survivors in order to win. There are alot of different killers each with their own unique gameplay and perks. Some killers are able to go invisible or even stealth while other killers are using deadly tools to get their victims. The killer has a first person camera perspective which means he can't use their camera to look around the walls for victims. Killers are able to see ALL Generators and exit gates throughout the match which could help you locating survivors.You will have to hunt down the survivors and they could reveal themself on the map if they are failing a skillcheck helping a survivor off the hook or destroying a hex totem. Chasing a survivor will start the ""Chase music"" until the victim is down or escaped. An injured or a running survivor will leave a trail of red marks around the location which you need to track down in order to kill them. A killer is able to hear nearby ""grunting/moaning"" sound when a survivor is injured. The killer is able to kick generators to slow and decrease the generator progress or destroying thrown pallets by kicking them. Killers are generally faster than a survivor and the killer's movement speed will increase the longer the chase goes as they have ""Bloodlust"". Survivor needs to escape from the map by completing generators to power up the exit gate or they are able to find a hatch. There are alot of different survivors each with their own gameplay and perks. Some are good for co op actions while others are quickly. Survivors have a third person camera which will allow them to see around the walls and keep the killer at a distance. You will have to find generators to power up the exit gates to make your escape.Generators are randomly spawned on the map and could be located by looking up as you will see sparky flashlights. From time to time you will receive a skillcheck which you will need to success in order to prevent the generator blowing up and able to reveal your location on the game. Blowing up generators will lose some of your progess and could put you into danger as well. By reparing enough generators the exit gates will be powered up and you COULD leave the area after opening the gates. You could also find a hatch which will allow you to escape but the killer is able to grab you out of the hatch if he is quick enough.There are 2 hitchecks on a skillcheck The thick white bar and a smaller bar. Before the skillcheck will pop up you will hear a ""ping"" sound. Hitting the Bigger white bar will gain you more experience and you will gain 2% more progress but you are better off focusing on the smaller bar as it will be alot easier to hit. Most actions ingame require a skillcheck and missing a skillcheck will reveal your location to the killer. You are able to find items in crates such a medkit or a toolbox. Items has a quality level and make them more powerful the higher it is. Items are usually an one time thing as you will lose them if you have died or they run out of charges. You are able to to carry an item to the next match if you have escaped.The survivor is able to jump over windows throw down pallets or hide in lockers. Lockers are not a good hiding location and you will be instantly grabbed by the killer if spotted. You are better off crouching and hiding behind obstactles. A common mistake what people are doing is Running. If they see a killer and it is close to a survivor they have a tendency to run which will be a big mistake as this will reveal your location to the killer alot easier. You should only start running when you are being chased or you know for sure the killer isn't close to you.Ingame Information. Moderate replayability. Good Atmosphere. Dark graphical horror atmosphere. Has Perks and level systems. Each survivor/killer has their own system. Dialy randoms quests to gain an insane ammount of experience.Miscellaneous Information. Dwight and Nea are both good beginning characters. Worst enemies could be your allies while the killer could be your friend. Pallets are buggy Don't throw the pallet if you are facing it. It could teleport you to the other side and screw you over.Other things.The game isn't that fun as it may seem. Why? If you are playing as a killer you will fight against a bunch of ""high"" skilled trolls and they are usally pre made as well. They are mostly pallet/window jumping flashlighting and shamefully t bagging.If you are playing as a survivor you will play against a killer that may be alot better than you are. Sometimes teammates are disconnecting in a middle of the match which will leave you in a disadvantage they also have the tendecies to really screw you over. Sometimes even on purpose.Survivors are generally alot more toxic salty trolly and generally have a negative attitude than a killer will ever get in this game. Killers mostly relies on mistakes from the survivors and sometimes are more friendlier than a survivor.I will only suggest to buy this game whenever it is in a discount. Otherwise i would suggest to stay away from it. The idea of the game is nice Community however isn't and can be really frustating or game ruining.I have reached the text review limit. T T '( Reviews are always uploaded if i have at least played for 2 hours or more. Unless the game is really garbage and doesn't deserve the 2H limit.I Give this game a 7/10",Dead by Daylight,hey everyone and this is my review about the gamethis is a multiplayer horror action game

have escaped the survivor is able to jump over windows throw down pallets or hide in lockers lockers are not a good hiding location and you will be instantly grabbed by the killer if spotted you are better off crouching and hiding behind obstactles a common mistake what people are doing is running if they see a killer and it is close to a survivor they have a tendency to run which will be a big mistake as this will reveal your location to the killer alot easier you should only start running when you are being chased or you know for sure the killer isnt close to you ingame information moderate replayability good atmosphere dark graphical horror atmosphere has perks and level systems each survivorkiller has their own system dialy randoms quests to gain an insane ammount of experience miscellaneous information dwight and nea are both good beginning characters worst enemies could be your allies while the killer could be your friend pallets are buggy dont throw the pallet if you are facing it it could teleport you to the other side and screw you over other things the game isnt that fun as it may seem why if you are playing as a killer you will fight against a bunch of high skilled trolls and they are usally pre made as well they are mostly palletwindow jumping flashlighting and shamefully t bagging if you are playing as a survivor you will play against a killer that may be alot better than you are sometimes teammates are disconnecting in a middle of the match which will leave you in a disadvantage they also have the tendecies to really screw you over sometimes even on purpose survivors are generally alot more toxic salty trolly and generally have a negative attitude than a killer will ever get in this game killers mostly relies on mistakes from the survivors and sometimes are more friendlier than a survivor i will only suggest to buy this game whenever it is in a discount otherwise i would suggest to stay away from it the idea of the game is nice community however isnt and can be really frustating or game ruining i have reached the text review limit t t  reviews are always uploaded if i have at least played for 2 hours or more unless the game is really garbage and doesnt deserve the 2h limit i give this game a

34,0,0,178,False,Not Recommended,The game is completely unbalanced it doesn't make sense 90% of the time The killer always has some sort of advantage and the perks you get for the survivor is cheap the game is literally one of the worst games I have ever played. Until they fix the balancing of the game I will no longer make purchases nor will I reinstall this piece of onto my computer again. Yeah they finally update the game and just make it worse for the survivor you can get 15 000 blood points in a single game but if you don't escape you don't get a pip. Also the other players you survive with most of the time at the end of the game will intentionally run the killer to you so they can escape and they let you die. I would not waste my money on this terrible game.

40,0,0,376,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is not a horror game. The theme and artistic guide of the game is horror but the game isn't scary. It's like when those youtubers play FNAF for views yet they look like they want to off themselves Dead by Daylight is not meant to scare you it's meant to challenge you.Now the game still holds incredible potential of fun. If you're a fan of the horror genre you're going to love the Dead by Daylight. The game features licensed killers from classic horror films like Leatherface Michael Meyers and remade version of Freddy Krueger (which imo is a piece of they added quentin instead of literally anybody else). The downside to this is that alot of these characters are locked behind an in game purchase door. You're gonna have to pay more money than the fee to start playing the game if you want to play the cool characters. The game holds a strong incentive to play. You level up your killers/survivors you get cool perks you get cool items and you can also get prestige! If you like farming for completion this game will keep you occupied.Now the downside the game has all the issues other online games have. There is a serious balance issues however the devs are working on it and the game is more balanced than ever according to Dead by Daylight's subreddit. Playing survivor is literally playing baby mode while playing killer is like smashing your head against your keyboard. If you plan on playing with friends you can only play survivor unless you have enough for a full 1v4 but you will not earn any points for kill your friends gamemode. The community is also INCREDIBLY toxic. Toxic communities to me are a sign of an utterly unfun game for people become toxic because the game angers them so much. And that is true. While you may have good games occasionally you will also have terrible games and those trials will put your mind to hell. Think of the game similar to CS GO and LoL. Toxic community hard core disconnectors garbonzo matchmaking yada yada.In the end the game is still great. If you enjoy competitive games this will be your type of game. If you want a high skill ceiling game play killer. If you want to play by dragging your balls from left to right on your keyboard and still win play survivor.TL DRThe game is not for everyone but most people will enjoy it to some degree. By the way if you bm as a survivor you are the degenerate scum that deserves to get shot down in the streets.,Dead by Daylight,dead by daylight is not a horror game the theme and artistic guide of the
